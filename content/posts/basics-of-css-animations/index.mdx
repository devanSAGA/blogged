I started learning CSS Animations, and in this article, I am briefly explaining 3 fundamental CSS properties that are at the core of CSS animations:
[transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition), [animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation), and [@keyframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes).

### transition

**`transition`** defines the transition between two diffrent state of an element. Here the different states could be **hover** / **active** / **focus**, etc.
Transitions always require a trigger (change in state) to run.

<iframe

  style="width:1024px; height:512px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

<br />

In the above example, we can see that without transition, the height change _snaps_ between two diffrent snaps.
`transition` property provides options to make this change smooth.

Let's break down the use of `transition` property in the above example:

**`transition`** is a shorthand syntax. it is made up of 4 CSS properties:
- [transition-property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-property): Defines the CSS properties to which the transition is going to apply.<br />
- [transition-duration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-duration): Defines the duration of the transition.<br />
- [transition-timing-function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function): Defines the behaviour and nature of the transition.<br />
- [transition-delay](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-delay): Defines the duration to wait before starting the transition effect.<br />

So in this example,

```css
/* property | duration | timing-function | delay  */
transition: height 2s ease-in 1s;
```

- The transition effect is applied to `height` property.
- The transition effect takes 2s.
- `ease-in` is the name of the effect.
- The transition effect starts applying after the wait of 1s.

Now, one thing to observe is that the `transition` is only limited to the initial and final state.
It can apply the transition effect to a property that is changing its value from A to B.

What if we want to control the intermediate state? i.e. What if we wanted to define multiple states of an element for one complete animation sequence? There comes the `@keyframes` CSS property.

### @keyframes

**`@keyframes`** enables you to define multiple states of element during the animation sequence.
This gives you more control over the intermediate states of the element. The syntax of the `@keyframes` goes like,

```css
@keyframes animation-identifier {
  0% {
    height: 64px;
  }

  25% {
    height: 128px;
  }

  50% {
    height: 96px;
  }

  75% {
    height: 100px;
  }

  100% {
    height: 64px;
  }
}
```

Here, we can observe that, we are able to define how the element styles should change
throughout the multiple stages of the animation sequence. We will see this in action, just in a bit!
Before that, I want to share one analogy that'll help you understand this concept better.

You can think of `@keyframes` as a function, where `animation-identifier` is the name of the function
and just like how we can reuse functions, we can reuse this animation and apply to any element. Now, `@keyframes` is analogous to **_defining the function_**,
i.e. writing the logic of how the function works. But we still need to **_invoke_** the function to make it work.

How do we invoke(apply) the animation defined inside `@keyframes`? There comes the `animation` CSS property.

### animation

**`animation`** allows you to apply the animation states that you have defined using `@keyframes`.

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/vigilant-raman-7u2cl?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&module=/index.html,styles.css"
  style="width:1024px; height:512px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>
<br />

<p
  style={{
    color: "#505050",
    marginBottom: '24px',
    fontSize: '12px',
    lineHeight: '1.5'
  }}
>
Note that, the <b><i>animation-identifier</i></b> name you have given to <i>@keyframes</i> is acting as a function name, and using inside `animation` property to apply the animation.
</p>

Just like `transition`, **`animation`** is also a shorthand for multiple CSS properties, although the list is a little bigger.
So we will only cover the ones which are frequently used. You can find the full list [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation#constituent_properties).

```css
/* animation-name | duration | timing-function | delay */
animation: animation-identifier 2s ease-out 1s;
```

- [animation-name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-name): Specifies name of the animation that you defined via @keyframes.<br />
- [animation-duration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-duration): Defines the duration of the animation.<br />
- [animation-timing-function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function): Defines the behaviour and nature of the animation.<br />
- [animation-delay](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-delay): Defines the time to wait from before starting the animation.<br />

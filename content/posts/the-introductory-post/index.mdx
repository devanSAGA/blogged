Hey, Thanks for stoping by!

This is the introductory first post on **Blogged** -- A collaborative blog between Chahak and Devansh.

Both of us realised that we have been learning some new things whether because it is needed in our job or just to calm down our curiosity.
So, this blog is an attempt to share whatever we are learning! You might expect posts on JavaScript, React, Git, Vim, Emacs, Design, Design Systems or sometimes random!

So let us introduce ourselves!

My name is Devansh, I am fron India and currently working as a Developer at [Postman](postman.com). I am interested in exploring things around modern web techologies.
But specifially, I am more inclined towards React, Design Systems and User Experience Design. You can find more about me and my work [here](http://devansaga.github.io/).

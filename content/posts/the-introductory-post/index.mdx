Hey, Thanks for stopping by!

This is the introductory first post on **Blogged** -- A collaborative blog between Chahak and Devansh.

Both of us realized that we have been learning some new things either because it is needed in our job or just to calm down our curiosity.
So, this blog is an attempt to share whatever we are learning! You might expect posts on JavaScript, React, Git, Vim, Emacs, Design, Design Systems, or sometimes something entirely random!

So let us introduce ourselves!

My name is Devansh, I am from India and currently working as a Developer at [Postman](postman.com). I am interested in exploring things around modern web technologies.
But specifically, I am more inclined towards Frontend Development, Design Systems, and User Experience Design. You can find more about me [here](http://devansaga.github.io/).

And hello! I am the other author writing this article, Chahak. I am also from India and am currently working on a research project with Prof. Tan Bui from UT Austin. Unlike my friend Devansh, I have *way* more random interests and I sometimes just pick something up to learn on a whim. (PS: Check out my first article on how I suddenly switched to using vim full time - I did it on a Wh(v)im :))

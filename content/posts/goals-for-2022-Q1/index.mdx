2021 was a good year for me. I was able to achieve a few milestones, but at the same time, I realized that I would have been able to achieve
some missed milestones if I have planned and prioritized my actions better. Keeping in mind the learnings, especially from the past year I want
to experiment with adopting a more structured way of defining my goals and intentions for 2022.
